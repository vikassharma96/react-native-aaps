### React Native

For custom fonts - create react-native.config.js file and run react-native link
UseRef - hook that allows us to create an object which we can bind to inputs to get access to them in the code. It allows us to define a value which survives component re-renders.
Dimensions - It's a great API for finding out how many pixels you have available on the width and on the height on the device or running on and that's important, where percentage here always refers to the direct parent view and not always to the available width of the device.
Platform specific code files - Button.android.js and Button.ios.js
SafeAreaView
