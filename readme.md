### React Native

React Navigation V5 -
use navigation.push() when want to navigate to the same page which is not possible with navigation.navigate()
goBack() - to go back
popToTop() - go back to the first screen in the stack
replace - replace current
Passing data between components and navigation options using setparams and getparams
useEffect, useCallback, useLayoutEffect
useCallback - this allows us to wrap a function so that this function is actually cached by React and is only recreated if its dependencies changed. only updates when state changes.
